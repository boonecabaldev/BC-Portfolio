# Portfolio of Boone Cabal

Welcome to my portfolio! Below, you'll find a curated selection of my technical articles and projects that showcase my expertise in web development, Linux, Vim, and innovative software solutions. Each piece reflects my passion for crafting efficient, elegant, and practical tools for developers and users alike.

## Writing

- **[Autopsy of Hope](https://1drv.ms/w/c/99c6e78ef02d9381/EeIA3mEzRwZCr7SRwR6_7gkBEzUUAoL_dLuv_JygKgcJog)**  

  *Autopsy of Hope* is a philosophical testimony that dissects suffering as a recursive system, rejecting consolation and exposing the architecture of despair. Structured in three movements—Hell Theory, The Spiral, and Character Bound—it documents isolation, trauma, and ethical resistance with unflinching precision.


- **[Meta live interview about Autopsy of Hope](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hopeforhealingnetwork/permalink/1222742602670094/)**  

  This was a live interview that I did with the Facebook group *Hope for Healing Network*, covering sections I and II of *Tm Autopsy of Hope*.

## AI

Here are some of my smaller AI projects.

### Character.AI

- **[Prompt: Character.AI image-to-profile](https://1drv.ms/t/c/99c6e78ef02d9381/Ec73vM9r8EdMgjFb87FtlqsB7-izXkwwH8hvw1kjaa2YPA?e=h7FJzk)**

  A prompt that, given only a portrait image, generates a complete character profile—first producing a generic persona, then formatting it into a Character.AI-specific template. This two-step process enables compatibility with other AI platforms by decoupling the core profile from the final template.

- **[Prompt: Add dialogues to Character.AI profile Definition](https://1drv.ms/t/c/99c6e78ef02d9381/EVh6UIzIYzBFpJ7Or-_mpLUBbPkP0GN1rB8eYi2oQknqEQ?e=CicsZm)**

  A prompt that takes a Character.AI character profile Definition JSON (generated by the previous prompt) and produces 30 sample dialogues for use in the Definition field.

- **[Instructions on how to use the above prompts](https://onedrive.live.com/:w:/g/personal/99C6E78EF02D9381/EWdaBT6PeXpAiMkUN8_b3nUBpMij-CvtUv_SaaDfbME5Qw?resid=99C6E78EF02D9381!s3e055a67798f407a88c91437cfdbde75&ithint=file%2Cdocx&e=ruMFVf&migratedtospo=true&redeem=aHR0cHM6Ly8xZHJ2Lm1zL3cvYy85OWM2ZTc4ZWYwMmQ5MzgxL0VXZGFCVDZQZVhwQWlNa1VOOF9iM25VQnBNaWotQ3Z0VXZfU2FhRGZiTUU1UXc_ZT1ydU1GVmY)**
